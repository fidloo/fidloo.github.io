## Terms

By accessing our app, Cinexplore, you are agreeing to be bound by these terms of service, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing Cinexplore. The materials contained in Cinexplore are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.

## Use License

Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of Cinexplore per device for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not: modify or copy the materials; use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial); attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained in Cinexplore; remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or transfer the materials to another person or “mirror” the materials on any other server. This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Fidloo at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.

## Disclaimer

The materials within Cinexplore are provided on an ‘as is’ basis. Fidloo makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights. Further, Fidloo does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to Cinexplore.

## Limitations

In no event shall Fidloo or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use Cinexplore, even if Fidloo or a Fidloo authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

## Accuracy of materials

The materials appearing in Cinexplore could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. Fidloo does not warrant that any of the materials on Cinexplore are accurate, complete or current. Fidloo may make changes to the materials contained in Cinexplore at any time without notice. However Fidloo does not make any commitment to update the materials.

## In-App Purchases

If you purchase an auto-renewing periodic subscription through the Service, your Google Play Store account will be billed continuously for the subscription until you terminate it as set forth below. After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically renew for an additional equivalent period. If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to your Google Play Store account and follow instructions to terminate or change your subscription, even if you have deleted your account.

In the Service, you may purchase Virtual Items, with “real world” money, such as a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable Premium license, solely for use in the Service. You are allowed to purchase Virtual Items through the Service, and not in any other way.

Cinexplore may manage, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Virtual Items (such as Premium pass for instance) at any time, with or without notice. Cinexplore may update the pricing of the Premium license at any time in its sole discretion, and may add new Virtual Items for additional fees. Cinexplore shall have no liability to you or any third party in the event that Cinexplore exercises any such rights.

The transfer of Virtual Items is prohibited except where expressly authorized in the Service. Other than as expressly authorized in the Service, you shall not sell, redeem or otherwise transfer Virtual Items to any person or entity, including but not limited to Company, another user, or any third party.

You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using a Cinexplore account registered to you. Cinexplore may revise the pricing for the goods and services offered through the Service at any time. All information that you provide in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Service must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Service at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. You will pay any applicable taxes, if any, relating to any such purchases, transactions or other monetary transaction interactions.

Fidloo has not reviewed all the sites linked to its app and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Fidloo of the site. Use of any such linked website is at the user’s own risk.
